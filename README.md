# Boston-Housing
The Data-set:
The dataset used contains housing price data from Boston, Massachusetts, USA; a description can be found here. 
This is a common data set and is available directly in R and in the sklearn.datasets module from scikit-learn in Python.

Target:
Choose a variable other than CHAS and MEDV (the target, median home price).
Compute the mean and standard deviation of the variable.
Plot a histogram of the variable.
What is the sample correlation between your chosen variable and median home price?
Perform a regression, predicting MEDV from your chosen variable.
 
You have a theory that tracts that border the Charles River (CHAS) will have higher median price (MEDV or target) than those that do not.
What is the null hypothesis?
Calculate the p-value. Use the sample mean of the target as an estimate of the population mean.
What is the 90% confidence interval for the target (price) of tracts that border the Charles River?
Assume an effect size (Cohenâ€™s d) of 0.6. If you want 80% power, what group size is necessary?
